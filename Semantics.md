Antonyms can be divided into two types: 

-	Gradable as for example big / small, which can be used in comparative constructions. Negation of the one world is not equal with the meaning of the other one.
-	Non-gradable (complementary pairs) as for example dead / alive. The negation of non-gradable antonym is equal to the meaning of the opposite word in pair.

Another group of antonyms are reversive antonyms. These are pairs as dress / undress, they can be treated as opposite words. However, as the author emphasises the word “undress” does not mean “not dress” but “do the reverse of dress”.
