## Semantics

### Semantic roles
Semantic roles denote the function of a word in a sentence. They are also called thematic roles.

### Antonymy
Antonyms are words with two forms of opposite meanings for example: alive / dead or fast / slow. Antonyms can be divided into two types: 

-	Gradable as for example big / small, which can be used in comparative constructions. Negation of the one world is not equal with the meaning of the other one.
-	Non-gradable (complementary pairs) as for example dead / alive. The negation of non-gradable antonym is equal to the meaning of the opposite word in pair.

Another group of antonyms are reversive antonyms. These are pairs as dress / undress, they can be treated as opposite words. However, as the author emphasises the word “undress” does not mean “not dress” but “do the reverse of dress”.

### Homophones and homonyms

 In cases where multiple written words have the same pronunciation, they are referred to as **homophones**. Some examples of **homophones** include *meat* and *meet*, *flour* and *flower* or *right* and *write*.

  **Homonyms** are a term used when one form (written or spoken) has more than one unrelated meaning, in the example of *bank (of a river)* – *bank (financial institution)*. We are inclined to assume that two types of bank are somehow related in meaning, which is actually not the case. **Homonyms** are words which are not related to each other in any way, but have accidentally come to have exactly the same form. 

### Polysemy

 Yule defines **polysemy** as having *“one form (written or spoken) having multiple meanings that are all related by extension”*. Words like *head*, referring to the object on top of your body, on top of a glass of beer or a person at the top of a company or department are a good example of **polysemy**.
 
  To explore **polysemy** and **homonymy**, dictionaries can be used. When the word is ***polysemous***- meaning that it has multiple meanings, it usually has a single entry in a dictionary, where all meanings are explained. When two words are regarded as **homonymous**, they are usually under two separate entries. Two forms of a word can also be distinguished through **homonymy**, and a number of uses can also be observed via **polysemy**. For example, words *date (= a thing we can eat)* and *date (=a point in time*) are homonyms. However, they have different uses, and can be interpreted in terms of  ‘date’ as in the ‘point in time’ kind of date is polysemous in terms of a particular day and month, an arranged meeting time, a social meeting, or even a person that we are seeing.

### Word Play

**Homophones**, **homonyms** and **polysemy** are often used in **word play**, usually for humorous effect. Yule gives an example of the nursery rhyme *‘Mary had a little lamb’*, which makes us think of a small animal, but in a version where Mary had *a little* lamb, some rice and vegetables, we think of a small amount of meat. The **polysemy** of lamb allows the two interpretations. 

### Metonymy

Another type of relationship between words, which concerns a close connection in everyday experience of the word, is called **metonymy**. An example of such relation can be *‘bottle/water’*, *‘ can/juice’* based on a container–contents relation or *‘car/wheels’*, *‘house/roof’* which is a whole–part relation). Our familiarity with **metonymy** allows us to understand sentences such as: *‘He drank the whole bottle’*, we are aware that what is being drank are the liquid contents of the bottle, rather than the physical, glass object.

Many examples of **metonymy** are used often in everyday life and are easy to interpret and understand. However, other examples can be a lot trickier, as they depend on our ability to deduce what the speaker has in mind. As Yule mentions, *“the metonymy in ‘Get your butt over here’ is easier to understand if you are used to informal talk in the United States”*. Understanding and expression like this will depend on our knowledge of the context and inference.  

### Collocation

**Collocation** regards the knowledge of which words occur with other words. Yule gives and example of *hammer* and *nail*, as one is almost always associated with the other. **Collocation** is a way in which our knowledge is organized, based on words occurring together. The topic of **collocation** has been explored further in the field of corpus linguistics. 

A **corpus** is a large collection of texts, spoken or written, typically stored as a database in a computer. Those doing corpus linguistics can then use the database to find out how often specific words or phrases occur and what types of **collocations** are most common.
