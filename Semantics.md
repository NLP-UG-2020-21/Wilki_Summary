# ***Summary***
# *Semantics*

**Semantics** is the study of the meaning of words, phrases and sentences. The focus here is on conventional rather than local meaning.

### ***Conceptual and associative meaning***
There are two kinds of meanings worth mentioning: **conceptual** meaning (covers those basic, essential components of meaning, so the most basic association) and **associative** (further associations). 


### ***Semantic features***
**Semantic features** are the features of words and their presence (+) or absence (-). We create semantic features ourselves, depending on the needs.


### ***Semantic roles***
Semantic roles denote the function of a word in a sentence. They are also called thematic roles.

### ***Antonymy***
Antonyms are words with two forms of opposite meanings for example: alive / dead or fast / slow. Antonyms can be divided into two types: 

-	**Gradable** as for example big / small, which can be used in comparative constructions. Negation of the one world is not equal with the meaning of the other one.
-	**Non-gradable** (complementary pairs) as for example dead / alive. The negation of non-gradable antonym is equal to the meaning of the opposite word in pair.

Another group of antonyms are **reversive antonyms**. These are pairs as dress / undress, they can be treated as opposite words. However, as the author emphasises the word “undress” does not mean “not dress” but “do the reverse of dress”.

### ***Homophones and homonyms***
 In cases where multiple written words have the same pronunciation, they are referred to as **homophones**. Some examples of homophones include meat and meet, flour and flower or right and write. **Homonyms** are a term used when one form (written or spoken) has more than one unrelated meaning, in the example of bank (of a river) – bank (financial institution). We are inclined to assume that two types of bank are somehow related in meaning, which is actually not the case. Homonyms are words which are not related to each other in any way, but have accidentally come to have exactly the same form. 

### ***Polysemy***
 Yule defines **polysemy** as having “one form (written or spoken) having multiple meanings that are all related by extension”. Words like head, referring to the object on top of your body, on top of a glass of beer or a person at the top of a company or department are a good example of polysemy. To explore polysemy and homonymy, dictionaries can be used. When the word is polysemous- meaning that it has multiple meanings, it usually has a single entry in a dictionary, where all meanings are explained. When two words are regarded as homonymous, they are usually under two separate entries. Two forms of a word can also be distinguished through homonymy, and a number of uses can also be observed via polysemy. For example, words date (= a thing we can eat) and date (=a point in time) are homonyms. However, they have different uses, and can be interpreted in terms of  ‘date’ as in the ‘point in time’ kind of date is polysemous in terms of a particular day and month, an arranged meeting time, a social meeting, or even a person that we are seeing.

# ***Discourse Analysis***

### ***Interpreting discourse***
To arrive at an interpretation, and to make our messages interpretable, we certainly rely on what we know about linguistic form and structure, but, as language-users, we have more knowledge than that.

### ***Cohesion***
**Cohesion** is the ties and connections that exist within texts.

**Cohesive ties** are  connections between phrases such as: ‘a Lincoln convertible’ – *that car*, *the convertible*; ‘money’ – *bought*, *saving*; ‘time’ – *once*, *nowadays*, *sometimes*. The analysis of these connections gives us a picture of whether a given text is well written or not. 

### ***Coherence***
**Coherence** (‘everything fitting together well’) is not something that exists in words or structures, but something that exists in people who create meaningful connections that are not actually expressed by the words and sentences. This process seems to be involved in our interpretation of all discourse.
