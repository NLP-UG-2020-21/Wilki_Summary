# ***Summary***
## **Semantics**

**Semantics** is the study of the meaning of words, phrases and sentences. The focus here is on conventional rather than local meaning.

### ***Conceptual and associative meaning***
There are two kinds of meanings worth mentioning: **conceptual** meaning (covers those basic, essential components of meaning, so the most basic association) and **associative** (further associations). 


### ***Semantic roles***
**Semantic roles** (also called **thematic roles**) denote the function of a word in a sentence. 


### ***Agent and theme***
The most common roles are agents and themes. **Agents** denote entities performing an action while **themes** (called as well **patients**) are entities which are involved in or affected by the action. They can be also the described entities, i.e. entities not performing an action.

## ***Instrument and experiencer***
**Instruments** are entities used by the agent to perform an action. If we do not perform an action but are experiencing feelings, perceptions or states, we are called **experiencers**.

### ***Location, source and goal***
The following semantic roles designate the location of an entity when describing an event:
- **location** describes where an entity is;
- **source** where an entity moves from;
- **goal** where an entity moves to.

### ***Lexical relations***
Words do not only serve as *containers* of meaning, their meanings can be explained by defining their 'relationships' with other words.
These 'relationships' are called **lexical relations** and are used in the semantic description of words. 

### ***Synonymy***
When two or more words have meanings which are closely related they are called **synonyms**. The words might not be interchangeable in all context and their usage might differ depending on the register.

### ***Antonymy***

Antonyms are words with two forms of opposite meanings for example: alive / dead or fast / slow. Antonyms can be divided into two types: 

-	**Gradable** as for example big / small, which can be used in comparative constructions. Negation of the one world is not equal with the meaning of the other one.
-	**Non-gradable** (complementary pairs) as for example dead / alive. The negation of non-gradable antonym is equal to the meaning of the opposite word in pair.

Another group of antonyms are **reversive antonyms**. These are pairs as dress / undress, they can be treated as opposite words. However, as the author emphasises the word “undress” does not mean “not dress” but “do the reverse of dress”.

### ***Hyponymy***
The hyponymy occurs when the meaning of one word is included in the meaning of another, as in the following examples: *animal* / *dog*, *flower* / *rose*. The word *rose* is considered as a hyponym of the word *flower*, because *rose* includes the meaning of the word *flower*. 
Meanings of hyponyms can be connected in some type of hierarchical relationship using hierarchical diagram. It can be said that a *horse* is a hyponym of *animal* or *cockroach* is a hyponym of *insect*. Words *animal* and *insect* are so called **superordinate terms**. What is more, two or more words can share the same superordinate term. These words are called **co-hyponyms**, for example *dog* and *horse* are both hyponyms of the word *animal*.
The author emphasises that sometimes the only information we have about particular word is that it is a hyponym of the other word.

### ***Prototypes***
There are many words which are easily considered as co-hyponyms of the superordinate word. However, classification of some of them might be more complicated. The author gives the example of the word *shirts*, which is usually quicker recognised and easier to characterise as a hyponym of the word *clothing* than other terms like for example *shoes*. The idea of this characteristic instance of category is known as the **prototype**. This means that *shirts* are much closer to the prototype of *clothing*. 
In fact, peoples’ personal experiences and preferences can have an impact on their first choices in that case, which leads to disagreements. 

### ***Homophones and homonyms***
 In cases where multiple written words have the same pronunciation, they are referred to as **homophones**. Some examples of homophones include meat and meet, flour and flower or right and write. **Homonyms** are a term used when one form (written or spoken) has more than one unrelated meaning, in the example of bank (of a river) – bank (financial institution). We are inclined to assume that two types of bank are somehow related in meaning, which is actually not the case. Homonyms are words which are not related to each other in any way, but have accidentally come to have exactly the same form. 

### ***Polysemy***
 Yule defines **polysemy** as having “one form (written or spoken) having multiple meanings that are all related by extension”. Words like head, referring to the object on top of your body, on top of a glass of beer or a person at the top of a company or department are a good example of polysemy. To explore polysemy and homonymy, dictionaries can be used. When the word is polysemous- meaning that it has multiple meanings, it usually has a single entry in a dictionary, where all meanings are explained. When two words are regarded as homonymous, they are usually under two separate entries. Two forms of a word can also be distinguished through homonymy, and a number of uses can also be observed via polysemy. For example, words date (= a thing we can eat) and date (=a point in time) are homonyms. However, they have different uses, and can be interpreted in terms of  ‘date’ as in the ‘point in time’ kind of date is polysemous in terms of a particular day and month, an arranged meeting time, a social meeting, or even a person that we are seeing.

### ***Word Play***

**Homophones**, **homonyms** and **polysemy** are often used in **word play**, usually for humorous effect. Yule gives an example of the nursery rhyme *‘Mary had a little lamb’*, which makes us think of a small animal, but in a version where Mary had *a little* lamb, some rice and vegetables, we think of a small amount of meat. The **polysemy** of lamb allows the two interpretations. 

### ***Metonymy***

Another type of relationship between words, which concerns a close connection in everyday experience of the word, is called **metonymy**. An example of such relation can be *‘bottle/water’*, *‘ can/juice’* based on a container–contents relation or *‘car/wheels’*, *‘house/roof’* which is a whole–part relation). Our familiarity with **metonymy** allows us to understand sentences such as: *‘He drank the whole bottle’*, we are aware that what is being drank are the liquid contents of the bottle, rather than the physical, glass object.

Many examples of **metonymy** are used often in everyday life and are easy to interpret and understand. However, other examples can be a lot trickier, as they depend on our ability to deduce what the speaker has in mind. As Yule mentions, *“the metonymy in ‘Get your butt over here’ is easier to understand if you are used to informal talk in the United States”*. Understanding and expression like this will depend on our knowledge of the context and inference.  

### ***Collocation***

**Collocation** regards the knowledge of which words occur with other words. Yule gives and example of *hammer* and *nail*, as one is almost always associated with the other. **Collocation** is a way in which our knowledge is organized, based on words occurring together. The topic of **collocation** has been explored further in the field of corpus linguistics. 

A **corpus** is a large collection of texts, spoken or written, typically stored as a database in a computer. Those doing corpus linguistics can then use the database to find out how often specific words or phrases occur and what types of **collocations** are most common. 


## ***Discourse Analysis***

### ***Interpreting discourse***
To arrive at an interpretation, and to make our messages interpretable, we certainly rely on what we know about linguistic form and structure, but, as language-users, we have more knowledge than that.

### ***Cohesion***
**Cohesion** is the ties and connections that exist within texts.

**Cohesive ties** are  connections between phrases such as: ‘a Lincoln convertible’ – *that car*, *the convertible*; ‘money’ – *bought*, *saving*; ‘time’ – *once*, *nowadays*, *sometimes*. The analysis of these connections gives us a picture of whether a given text is well written or not. 

### ***Coherence***
**Coherence** (‘everything fitting together well’) is not something that exists in words or structures, but something that exists in people who create meaningful connections that are not actually expressed by the words and sentences. This process seems to be involved in our interpretation of all discourse.


### ***Speech Events***
Analyzing different types of speech events as debates, interviews and daily conversations, it can be noticed that there is enormous variation of what people might say in different situations. 
In order to describe these differences, variation of aspects should be taken into consideration. One of them is a role of the speaker as well as hearer. There are many factors to analyze as status, gender or relationship between them. Other elements to consider are the topic of conversation and setting where it takes place. All of these aspects have an influence on the information that is shared, as well as on the way how the speaker said it. 

### ***Conversation Analysis***
A typical English conversation can be described as an activity in which two or more people take turns at speaking. Commonly it is accepted that one person is speaking at the time. Participants of the conversation try to avoid silence between speaking turns as well.
Speakers use **completion points** to signalize that they have finished, and the other person can begin. To the completion points belongs:
-   questions
-   pauses at the end of a completed syntactic structure (phrase or sentence)

Participants of conversation can indicate their willingness to speak by:
-   making short sounds
-   body shifts
-   facial expressions

### ***Turn-taking***
According to the research, there are different strategies of participation in the conversation and different expectations of its style. Some of these styles might be understood as a rudeness or shyness by other participants, which is a result of different conventions of **turn-taking**.
One of typical strategies is avoiding completion points. Speakers use this in situations when they try to talk and figure out the context of their speech at the same time. As a method to avoid completion points speakers do not make pauses at the end of sentences and use different connectors like *and*, *and then*, *so*, *but*. Trying to fill the silence markers as *er*, *em*, *uh*, *ah* or *you know* are used. 
The author emphasizes that these methods should not be considered as undesirable or domineering. Filled pauses occur in most of conversations and they are an important part of it used to organize speakers turns.
### ***The cooperative principle***

The **cooperative principle** was first described by the philosopher Paul Grice and is based on the assumption that in the majority of conversations the participants cooperate with one another. Though it is not applied in every conversational exchange it helps to explain regular features present in the majority of conversations. The co-operative principle is supported by four **maxims** (also known as **Gricean maxims*):
- The **quantity maxim**: *Make your contribution as informative as required, but not more, or less than is required.*
- The **quality maxim**: *Do not say that which you believe to be false or for which you lack adequate evidence.*
- The **relation maxim**: *Be relevant.*
- The **manner maxim**: *Be clear, brief, and orderly.*

### ***Hedges***
**Hedges** are words or phrases which indicate our lack of certainty regarding what we are saying, whether our statement is complete or that our enunciation denotes an opinion. We use them while being co-operative participants to point to our concern about four maxims.

### ***Implicature***
An **implicature** is a piece of information conveying an additional conveyed meanining. We decide whether a conversation contains an implicature based on the co-operative principle and the maxims and as well by appealing to our background knowledge. 

### ***Background knowledge***
Pieces of information not directly stated in the text are called **interferences**. They are derived from our conventional knowledge and expectations about a text and treated as likely or possible interpretations of a text which will be abandoned if they do not fit with the information to follow.

### ***Schemas and scripts***
Conventional knowledge structures which exist in our memory containing a set of typical features are called **schemas**. **Scripts** are series of conventional actions taking place. Schemas and scripts confirm that our understanding does not come directly from words and sentences but as well the interpretations as crucial information can be ommited on the assumption of the knowledge of the scripts by conversational partners.
