# Summary
## Semantics

### Semantic roles
Semantic roles denote the function of a word in a sentence. They are also called thematic roles.

### Antonymy
Antonyms are words with two forms of opposite meanings for example: alive / dead or fast / slow.

### Homophones and homonyms

 In cases where multiple written words have the same pronunciation, they are referred to as homophones. Some examples of homophones include meat and meet, flour and flower or right and write. Homonyms are a term used when one form (written or spoken) has more than one unrelated meaning, in the example of bank (of a river) – bank (financial institution). We are inclined to assume that two types of bank are somehow related in meaning, which is actually not the case. Homonyms are words which are not related to each other in any way, but have accidentally come to have exactly the same form. 

### Polysemy

 Yule defines polysemy as having “one form (written or spoken) having multiple meanings that are all related by extension”. Words like head, referring to the object on top of your body, on top of a glass of beer or a person at the top of a company or department are a good example of polysemy. To explore polysemy and homonymy, dictionaries can be used. When the word is polysemous- meaning that it has multiple meanings, it usually has a single entry in a dictionary, where all meanings are explained. When two words are regarded as homonymous, they are usually under two separate entries. Two forms of a word can also be distinguished through homonymy, and a number of uses can also be observed via polysemy. For example, words date (= a thing we can eat) and date (=a point in time) are homonyms. However, they have different uses, and can be interpreted in terms of  ‘date’ as in the ‘point in time’ kind of date is polysemous in terms of a particular day and month, an arranged meeting time, a social meeting, or even a person that we are seeing.
